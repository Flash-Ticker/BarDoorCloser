**Description**

Who has ever walked through a real bar door? 🏜️
I loved it as a child. Preferably with a lot of effort so that the door slams completely open on the other side.
It bothered me so much that these doors don't close automatically!
That's why i have written a plugin which i would like to offer you for free download. 🌵

I would be happy if you also look at my other works.
Have fun with your new bar doors 🤠


**load, run, enjoy** 💝
